When designing the first iteration of this program, I outlined 4 main goals:
1. Functional GUI that allows you to initialize information from a ticker, access saved tickers
2. Allow user to set portfolios full of tickers
3. Sort by sectors / competitors
4. Good visualization on pros/cons of each competitor, easily comparable

After developing the first iteration, I can say that I met 3 out of the 4 of these requirements. What I didn't add was add information
by sector or competitors.

Additionally, I was at first planning on having a my stocks screen and a stock research screen. After working on the program, I 
decided the distinction wasn't important enough to warrant the time in developing it, so the user can just use the stock research
screen for all research, planning, and portfolio creation.

Here are some things to implement in future versions:
1. Debt tracker / trackers
2. Cash flows
3. Sectors / Competitors
4. Automatic generation of symbols from general information such as s&p stocks, sector-specific stocks, or competitors, so you don't
    have to constantly add new symbols manually
5. Defining data such as EV, EBIT 
6. Ability to "turn off" different statistics to make viewing easier
7.
